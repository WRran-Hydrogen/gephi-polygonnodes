Extends and replaces default node renderer and implements polygon shaped nodes.

Allows for nodes to be rendered as a regular polygon with an arbitrary number of sides by 
adding a column of Integers in the data table named "Polygon." The value corresponds to the number of sides.
NOTE: the renderer must be enabled in the "Manage Renderers" tab.
